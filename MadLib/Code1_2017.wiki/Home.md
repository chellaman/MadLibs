# Welcome to the Code1_2017 wiki!

Our syllabus can be found online on [This Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wlC_z4_MgdXfe4mnk-O6PhTYFgKKvvlrCdmOEA5aqaE/edit?usp=sharing)

# Homework Submission Guidelines:  
Each Homework will have its own page on the right of this wiki. To get credit, you'll need to put a link to your repo under the appropriate heading by **Monday Night at Midnight!** I want to be able to go over people's work before I get into class.
